## Getting Started

- Make sure you have a [Github account](https://github.com/signup/free).
- Make sure you have a [YouVersion account](https://www.bible.com/sign-up).
- Join our Open Digerati Slack Channel:
  - Go to [OpenDigerati.com](https://opendigerati.com/)
  - Click the *Slack* link at the top of the page
  - Enter and then verify your email
  - Once you're in the Open Digerati workspace, look for the `#yv-image-source` channel
  - Once you're in the `#yv-image-source` channel, mention me (`@Michael Martin`) so I can add you to our `YouVersion Volunteers` team in Github.

## Package Manager

For this project, we're using `yarn` as our package manager. You can get instructions to install it [here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).

## Pick Your First Issue

We're using Github Projects and Issues to manage this project. Everything that needs to be done is organized into bite-sized issues that can usually be completed in a few hours. No contribution is too small, so even if you only have a couple of hours available there's something for you.

- Open the [Image Source Project Board](https://github.com/lifechurch/img-src/projects/1)
- Find an Issue card in the `To do` column that isn't assigned to anyone. The highest priority items are at the top of the list.
- Open the issue and assign it to yourself. If you don't see your name in the list of assignees, make sure you were added to the `YouVersion Volunteers` team in Github.
- Go back to the [Image Source Project Board](https://github.com/lifechurch/img-src/projects/1) and drag your Issue into the `In progress` column.
- There will be many volunteers contributing to this project, so please don't assign as issue to yourself until you're ready to start working. And, if you've assigned an issue to yourself that you cannot work on, un-assign the issue and drag the card back to the `To do` column for someone else to pick up.

## Git Guidelines

- Clone this repo
- Create a branch with the following naming convention: `{your-initials}/issue-{issue-id}`. For example, I might create a branch called `mm/issue-1`.
- Write your code. Do your best to make each commit fully functional. In other words, don't commit code to your branch that you know is not working.
- Don't include closing keywords (`Closes #2` or `Fixes #1`) on the individual commits.
- When your feature is complete and ready for review submit a Pull Request. In the body of the request, include a line stating which issue the PR addresses. Like this, `Fixes #1`. This is vital to our project workflow. Otherwise, it's cumbersome to determine which issues have been resolved.

## Running it Locally

```Bash
cd /path/to/cloned/repo
yarn start
```

## Writing Code

Now that you have your first issue, it's time to write some code. But, before you dive in let's talk about a few things. I promise we're not mean or rude. We want to lower the bar for contribution as low as possible. But, we do have a few expectations for this project.

### ESLint

We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to perform a static analysis of our code and identify problematic patterns and style issues that don't line up with the way we do things. Most IDEs and text editors support `ESlint`. We recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or even [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). They each have plugins that automatically validate your code against our linting rules every time you save a file. Plus, we use [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/) to check all of your code when you submit a Pull Request.

If your code violates any of our linter rules, we probably won't merge your Pull Request until you fix them. Don't worry! ðŸ˜° We'll work with you to fix the issues so your hard work doesn't go to waste.

### CSS

For this project, we're using the [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/docs/) CSS framework. Using the framework keeps our CSS [D.R.Y](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). Tachyons defines numerous classes for margin, padding, typography, grid layouts and more. Be sure to checkout [tachyons.io](http://tachyons.io/docs/) for documentation on what's available.

Since Tachyons is so comprehensive, we rarely need to create or modify CSS classes. That also means that we rarely need new CSS, LESS or SASS files. So, as you're building your components do your best to use Tachyons classes exclusively. If you define new CSS classes or add new CSS files, we probably won't merge your Pull Request without proper justification. But, admittedly, there will likely be a FEW exceptions to this -- but only go outside of Tachyons as a last resort.

### PropTypes

Be sure to define [PropTypes](https://github.com/facebook/prop-types) for every property on the React components you build. This is part of the linter rules, but it's worth mentioning again. These PropTypes define the component contract that other developers will need when trying to use your component

### Component Naming and Folder Structure

For naming your components, here's a few general guidelines:
- Don't include the word `component` in the file name or the class name
- Name your files using hyphens (i.e. `./components/round-button.js`) instead of `camelCase`
- Name your classes using camelCase (i.e. `class RoundButton extends Component`)
- Small UI components used in multiple places should be located in `/src/components/{component-name}/index.js`
- Page-level components that are tied to routes should be located in `/src/containers/{container-name}/index.js`
- UI components that are only used once, but don't represent a full page should be stored under the container in which they're rendered: `/src/containers/{container-name}/components/{component-name}/index.js`

### Localization

We're building this app for the international community, so we want to eventually make it available in over 40 languages. Right from the start, we've built localization support in using `react-intl`. What does that mean for you? When you display a date, time or string in the UI, never output the value directly. Here are the basic rules:

#### Dates and Times

For dates and times, use `FormattedDate`, `FormattedTime` or `FormattedRelative` [See docs](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl/wiki/Components#date-formatting-components)

```
import { FormattedTime, FormattedDate, FormattedRelative } from 'react-intl'

...

<FormattedDate value={new Date(1459832991883)}/>
// returns <span>4/5/2016</span>


<FormattedDate
  value={new Date(1459832991883)}
  year='numeric'
  month='long'
  day='2-digit'
/>
// returns <span>April 05, 2016</span>


<FormattedTime value={new Date(1459832991883)}/>
// returns <span>1:09 AM</span>

<FormattedRelative value={Date.now()}/>
// returns <span>now</span>
// 10 seconds later it returns <span>10 seconds ago</span>
// 60 seconds later it returns <span>1 minute ago</span>
```

#### Strings

For strings, first add the string to `/locales/en.json` with a descriptive key. That file might look something like this:

```
{
  "splashPage": "Splash Page",
  "userRegistration": "User Registration",
  "userVerseAssignment": "User Verse Assignment",
  "userProfile": "User Profile: {user}",
  "admin": "Admin"
}
```

After you add it to the locale file, you can display it using the `FormattedMessage` component. The `id` property of `FormattedMessage` should match the key you added to the JSON file. Like this:

```
import { FormattedMessage } from 'react-intl'

...

<FormattedMessage id="splashPage" />
// returns <span>Splash Page</span>
```

For strings with placeholders, like the `userProfile` example above:

```
<FormattedMessage id="userProfile" values={{ user: 'Michael ' }} />
// returns <span>User Profile: Michael</span>
```

If you submit a Pull Request with hardcoded strings, dates or times that aren't rendered using `react-intl` components, we'll point you to the process outlined above.



### Smoke Tests

Every React component you submit should be accompanied by a *smoke test*. A *smoke test* is a simple test to ensure a component renders without crashing. Here's an example:

```JavaScript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

it('renders without crashing', () => {
  const div = document.createElement('div');
  ReactDOM.render(<App />, div);
});
```

Name your tests the same way you name your component, but with a `.test.js` extension. The component and its test should be in the same folder, with the same base filename.

Feel free to include more advanced logic in addition to the simple smoke test. ***Remember, if you encounter issues with a component while developing it, that's probably a test case that needs to be automated.***

You can run all the tests in the project like this:
```Bash
yarn test
```
